    "In the case of asynchronous copy which newer Nvidia gpus provide, the kernel asks the hardware to start copying a rectangular block of a matrix from global memory into on-chip shared memory, and the kernel can keep doing other work while that copy is in flight—then later it synchronizes (waits) before using the data.\n",

    "“Asynchronous” means:\n",
    "1. the instruction initiates the copy and returns immediately,\n",
    "2. the data may not be available in shared memory yet,\n",
    "3. you later do a wait/barrier before reading that shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables overlap (pipelining):\n",
    "1. while you compute on tile k already in shared memory,\n",
    "2. the hardware is copying tile k+1 into another shared-memory buffer.\n",

    "A team of work-groups that are forced to run close together and can coordinate. A small number of blocks can cooperate more like a “super work-group.” Within a cluster, a block can read/write/atomic into another block’s shared memory. NVIDIA calls this Distributed Shared Memory. Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) is an async copy engine that can move tensor-shaped data between global ↔ shared, and even between shared memory regions of different SMs in the same cluster. Hence the main benefit of clusters is sharing each others local memory.\n",

    "CTA pairs (Blackwell/SM100) = “two work-groups inside a cluster that are paired so tightly the hardware treats them like one bigger matrix-multiply unit for certain instructions.” Pairs can only be 2 ctas but can cordinate on memory as well as compute. Two CTAs inside the same cluster that are scheduled “on the same or adjacent SMs” and can coordinate more deeply—specifically for tensor-core work(MMAs). They can:\n",

    "Suppose multiple(4 in our case) different work groups have to load (or send) the same data. \n",

    "1. Memory bandwidth as well as copy instructions are saved. \n",

    "\n",
    "When work-items in the same SIMD execution group (warp/sub-group) access consecutive global addresses, the hardware combines those per-lane loads/stores into fewer, larger memory transactions. This is memory coalescing which is different from multicast which reduces redundant global-memory traffic by distributing one fetch to multiple in cluster CTAs/work-groups. The CTAs has to be part of cluster. "

    "\n",
    "1. SM90 keeps accumulators in per-thread registers; SM100 keeps accumulators in a CTA-owned TMEM tile. SM90 doesnt have TMEM. SM100 cant have input in TMEM. Only can you keep intermediate results of tensor operations in TMEM. TMEM has more restrictions than local memory. The benefit of TMEM is fast memory for intermediate results of compute which helps free registers leading to higher block size/ work group size. TMEM is for tensor cores (not general purpose) and can be used nu one CTA or CTA pair.\n",
